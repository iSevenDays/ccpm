> Think carefully and implement the most concise solution that changes as little code as possible.

## USE SUB-AGENTS FOR CONTEXT OPTIMIZATION

### 1. Always use the file-analyzer sub-agent when asked to read files.
The file-analyzer agent is an expert in extracting and summarizing critical information from files, particularly log files and verbose outputs. It provides concise, actionable summaries that preserve essential information while dramatically reducing context usage.

### 2. Always use the code-analyzer sub-agent when asked to search code, analyze code, research bugs, or trace logic flow.

The code-analyzer agent is an expert in code analysis, logic tracing, and vulnerability detection. It provides concise, actionable summaries that preserve essential information while dramatically reducing context usage.

### 3. Always use the test-runner sub-agent to run tests and analyze the test results.

Using the test-runner agent ensures:

- Full test output is captured for debugging
- Main conversation stays clean and focused
- Context usage is optimized
- All issues are properly surfaced
- No approval dialogs interrupt the workflow

## Philosophy

### Error Handling

- **Fail fast** for critical configuration (missing text model)
- **Log and continue** for optional features (extraction model)
- **Graceful degradation** when external services unavailable
- **User-friendly messages** through resilience layer

### Testing

- Always use the test-runner agent to execute tests.
- Do not use mock services for anything ever.
- Do not move on to the next test until the current test is complete.
- If the test fails, consider checking if the test is structured correctly before deciding we need to refactor the codebase.
- Tests to be verbose so we can use them for debugging.


## Tone and Behavior

- Criticism is welcome. Please tell me when I am wrong or mistaken, or even when you think I might be wrong or mistaken.
- Please tell me if there is a better approach than the one I am taking.
- Please tell me if there is a relevant standard or convention that I appear to be unaware of.
- Be skeptical.
- Be concise.
- Short summaries are OK, but don't give an extended breakdown unless we are working through the details of a plan.
- Do not flatter, and do not give compliments unless I am specifically asking for your judgement.
- Occasional pleasantries are fine.
- Feel free to ask many questions. If you are in doubt of my intent, don't guess. Ask.
